## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. This project is an implementation of the game using TypeScript and Vite, providing an interactive interface to explore the fascinating patterns and behaviors of cellular automata.

## Features

- Interactive grid to set initial cell states
- Start, pause, and reset the simulation
- Seed the grid with random initial states
- Clear the grid to start from scratch
- Adjustable speed of the simulation (Slow, Medium, Fast)
- Responsive design
